# URL Checker

Two simple programs that bruteforce tinyurl and itnry.co combinations to find working ones
Maybe these services should increase amount of random letters & numbers?

Note:
!!! I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY ON ANY PAGES THAT THESE PROGRAMS MIGHT LEAD YOU
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! DESPITE THE NAME THESE PROGRAMS DO NO HACKING BUT JUST
SHOWS HOW WEAK A SHORT STRING IS TO BRUTEFORCE !!!

Usage:

If you have Python just run src/itnry_hacker.py or src/tinyurl_hacker.py

Example:

User types: 
* 3

Results might be:
* 3 urls shortened with tinyurl.com or itnry.co that lead to a some working webpage


# Known bugs:
* Null?
